# VARIABLES, CONSTANT AND STRINGS

A `Variable` is a container into which you can store
values — values that are unknown or values that can change.

C deals with different types of values, therefore a variable must be declared as a specific type.

In C, the variable type matches the variable’s content—the type of value being stored:

- `Int` variables hold only `integer values` or `whole numbers`.
- `Float` variables hold floating-point values only.
- `Char` variables hold single values such as the letter 'x'.
- The C language lacks a `string` variable type.
Instead, a character array is used.

## Declaration And Initialization Of Variables In C

In order to process different data types and data values in the computer, we need to declare and assign variables. 

`Declaring ` variables automatically allocates memory to values. 

`Declaring a variable:`
----
- data_type variable_name

    eg: `int` x;

    :- `int` is the data type and 

    :- `x` is the name of the variable.

`Initializing a variable:`
----

- name of variable = value 

    eg: x = 10; 

    :- `x` is assigned a value of 10.
