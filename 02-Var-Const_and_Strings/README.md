# VARIABLES, CONSTANT AND STRINGS

A `Variable` is a container into which you can store
values — values that are unknown or values that can change.

C deals with different types of values, therefore a variable must be declared as a specific type.

In C, the variable type matches the variable’s content—the type of value being stored:

- `Int` variables hold only `integer values` or `whole numbers`.
- `Float` variables hold floating-point values only.
- `Char` variables hold single values such as the letter 'x'.
- The C language lacks a `string` variable type.
Instead, a character array is used.
